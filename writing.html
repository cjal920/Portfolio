              <div class="modal-body">
                <p>The flashing eyes and glowing complexion of society girl Rose Lee, whose giggles and chatter directed to either side of her were more than sufficient to tell anyone not yet too plastered at the Central Park Casino that evening in late August that she was the center of attention at not just her own table, but at least the three or four others closest to it. And this was just the way she liked it.</p>
                <p>The Casino restaurant and nightclub had fast become a mainstay of Manhattan high society in just the few short months it had been in operation. Constructed during the Civil War, the property itself – nestled in the Park just off Fifth Avenue in the mid-seventies – belonged to the City and originally did business as something called the Ladies Refreshment Salon, a name that somehow stuck even after it went coed. But even girls with their boys wouldn’t be enough to make the place too terribly exciting. Not until Jimmy Walker got his hands on it. James John Walker was elected Mayor of New York City in 1926; and before his first term in City Hall was up, had managed to wrest this stale old relic from in the last century and turn it into the premier uptown playground of the ruling class. A rising star from the unhallowed halls of Tammany, Walker’s contempt for the law forbidding all manner of activities around intoxicating spirits was secret to no one. And because Rose’s penchant for flamboyance and disregard for Prohibition were enough to give even “Beau James” – as the popular young Democrat was known by admirers and rivals alike – a run for his money, this chicer-than-chic little spot where liquor flowed just as free and fast as wallets and taps would allow was now at the top of this high-spirited wild child’s short list of favorite places to see and be seen about town.</p>
                <p>And so, no less keenly aware of the goings-on around her as she was determined to satisfy the whims of her own vanity in those days, Rose was first to notice a scene unfolding far across the dining room that had so far gone unobserved by the other members of her party.</p>
                <p>Over by the entrance, beyond which lay the lawn stretching out to the Seventy-Second Street Transverse, a snooty host was having words with a young bohemian Rose instantly recognized as Cal Prince despite all the years it had been since their last meeting.</p>            
                <p>Cal was a childhood friend of Rose’s husband Alfred, the handsome young lawyer planted sturdily at her side. Cal’s presence here tonight was the result of a chance encounter that had taken place between Alfred and him earlier that week following a trip Alfred had taken down to Greenwich Village – where Cal was living – to see a client. Cal and Alfred had taken very different paths in life since their time growing up together in a poor section of Brooklyn during the years leading up to the Great War. Yet despite the vastly different social circles each now occupied and the resulting difficulty that caused maintaining ties, so strong was this early friendship that neither man had lost the esteem or respect he held for the other. Any misgivings Cal had about accepting Alfred’s invitation to join them for this Labor Day weekend dinner at the Casino, then, was only on account of the possibility of just such a predicament in which Rose – a wry smile curling her ruby red lips as she continued to look – now discovered him.</p>             
                <p>And as Rose got up from her place at the table, Alfred gently placed his hand on her delicate wrist just above the bracelet he’d recently presented to her for her twenty-eighth birthday.</p>                 
                <p>“Where are you going?” he asked Rose in that sense of urgency he reserved for her that came just short of sounding like parental nagging.</p>                
                <p>Having learned, albeit with some difficulty at first, not to take Alfred’s tone too much to heart, Rose replied with a kind of breezy highhandedness she used on him when he got like this, “Your chum is here, darling.”</p>
                <p>Alfred’s gaze followed Rose as she sashayed off toward the awkward encounter brewing at the front door she spied a moment earlier.</p>
                <p>Focused as he was on continuing to plead his case to the inflexible host, Cal – whose attire was a sight seldom seen anywhere north of Houston even as late as 1929 – was startled as Rose swooped in with kisses hello for each of his reddening cheeks</p>
                <p>“Why hello, my darling! It’s been ages. So glad you could make it,” Rose exclaimed.</p>
                <p>“Excuse me!” said the host in a tone that left little doubt about his lack of amusement or appreciation for Rose’s obliquely theatrical attempt to vouch for this interloper from the island’s foul underbelly.</p>
                <p>Allowing her head to sway back toward the source of the host’s bark, Rose blinked her thick lashes at him as if noticing his odious presence for the first time.</p>
                <p>“We have a strict dress code,” said the host, stepping forward and crossing his arms in such a way that showed off his gold-trimmed sleeves as if to make perfectly plain the conspicuous difference between his own pristine restaurant uniform and the fraying tweeds of Cal’s baggy jacket at which Rose saw him now glaring.</p>
                <p>“Lighten up, mac. It’s a holiday weekend."</p>
                <p>Hesitating to speak up sooner, Cal finally stepped forward, “Rose, it’s fine. I’ll just catch up with you and Alfred later.”</p>
                <p>“Shut up, Cal,” commanded Rose.</p>
                <p>“You should listen to your friend,” quipped the host with a snide look aimed at Cal in a way that only made Rose even more determined to undo him. But this wasn’t Rose’s first brush with uniformed staff at places like this. She had learned the hard way, many times over, that you can typically get a lot further with a little sugar than the venom she now so desperately wanted to use on this strutting little stooge. So taking in a deep breath to compose herself to sell it, Rose flashed the host the least phony smile she could muster.</p>

<p>
The extraordinary expansion in the size and complexity of private enterprise that attended the Industrial Revolution gave rise to the first truly big businesses the world had ever known. And in the form of the colossal railroad industry of the nineteenth century, the large-scale capitalist bureaucracy was born. In the century that followed the domination of the railroads, the term “bureaucracy” came to take on an almost exclusively pejorative meaning as any kind of organization that suffers from an excessive, convoluted reporting structure burdened by waste and a resistance to change. The case of General Motors during the end of the twentieth century – documenting the tumultuous period in which the automotive giant traded its rarified status as industry leader to that of hopelessly out-of-touch relic better known for its boondoggles than its cars, and its long struggle to recover at least some measure of its former glory – poses some interesting questions about the nature of bureaucracy itself. As an enterprise matures, enjoys success and scales according to the demands of its growing market share, is the shedding of the very entrepreneurial spirit that drove its original value proposition, and the steady accumulation of detrimental bureaucratic practices inevitable? And if the onset of bureaucracy is the natural extension of any successful organization over time, what qualities must be leveraged to drive high performance rather than inhibit it?</p> 
<p>By the 1980s, GM’s bureaucratic inertia that had already resulted in the loss of a significant portion of its share of the automotive market was made all the more apparent by the fresh dynamism of Ross Perot’s Electronic Data Systems (EDS) that GM Chairman and CEO Roger Smith had acquired in an attempt to modernize his flagging car company’s information management systems. Rather than succeeding in lifting GM from its slump, however, the attempt to graft the nimble data processing 
outfit onto his bloated operation created far more problems than it solved.</p> 
<p>The foresight Smith exhibited in understanding the need for change in his organization did not extend to fully appreciating EDS’s capabilities. Even more telling than the apparent mismatch between EDS’s expertise and GM’s needs, however, were the vast array of problems that arose from the fundamental differences between each firm’s culture and the men at their helms. Where GM’s managers resented EDS’s executives for the substantial financial compensation they were awarded through the unique pricing model that made EDS so competitive, EDS employees balked at the independence they surrendered when subjected to GM’s far more strictly regimented ways of doing things. The friction exhibited by their respective workforces was only magnified in the conflict of personalities between Perot and Smith themselves. While Smith had originally claimed to be seeking to “inject high-tech know and a can-do spirit into a stodgy company,” his loyalty to the status quo and aversion to change was brought into sharp relief by his increasingly public conflicts with Perot, culminating in the formal severance of their business relationship. As an outsider without the allegiance of a highly insular and intransigent organization, Perot didn’t stand a chance. </p>
<p>Yet while Smith would be rid of Perot, he would retain EDS, the company the Texas entrepreneur had founded twenty years earlier. Without Perot as its guiding force for the first time in its history, what happened to the culture of EDS without him is especially revealing about the nature of bureaucracy. In the wake of his unceremonious departure from the GM board in 1986 after Smith offered him twice the market value of his shares in the company to buy him out for $700 million during a time when GM was losing nearly half that much a quarter and laying off workers in the tens of thousands – a move that only further underlines the firm’s bureaucratic propensity 
for misguided priorities and misspending capital – serial entrepreneur Perot threw himself into his next business venture, Perot Systems Group. But did EDS retain its autonomous, entrepreneurial culture and continue to clash against GM without its founder? If Perot’s adversarial disposition toward EDS following his departure is any indication – outbidding it with an even more innovative pricing structure than the one he pioneered at his former company, filling key positions at Perot Systems with defecting EDS personnel, and receiving requests for employment from thousands more loyalists – then the answer is a most emphatic no; in the contest of cultures, bureaucracy prevailed. </p>
<p>During the era that followed the ultimately ineffectual reigns of Smith and Robert Stempel, his short-tenured successor (the same period that would see Perot bring his own particular brand of entrepreneurial spunk to national politics in two insurgent presidential bids), GM underwent a transformation at the hands of a new board of directors from outside the company purported to be as sweeping as any since the establishment of the reigning organizational structure pioneered by Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. that had stood for seven decades. Beginning by separating the role of GM chairman and CEO for the first time in thirty years, the outside directors sought in their new leader someone who could deliver on many of the revolutionary anti-bureaucratic prescriptions for GM articulated several years earlier by Perot – listening to the customer, rewarding the workforce, eliminating waste and banning authoritarianism. </p>
<p>While the major role he played in rescuing GM’s ailing European operations in the 1980s certainly figured prominently in the board’s decision to go with thirty year GM veteran Jack Smith to succeed Stempel as CEO, perhaps the most significant attribute this former payroll audit clerk had going for him was his reputation within the company as someone who “wasn’t a slave to the old ways of doings things.” These perceptions 
notwithstanding, however, the spirit of this Smith would ultimately prove to resemble that of his predecessor of the same name far more than the entrepreneurial mien of the man who railed against him a decade earlier.

                      <p>The object of this game is to make your score match the target number by collecting precious stones. And here's how it's done. The ruby, sapphire, citrine and emerald at the bottom of the screen each have a numerical value. Your job is to select the right stones in the right quantities so that your score adds up to the target. How do you know each stone's value? Well, you don't. Like market values, like the target you're aiming for, they fluctuate; each game they're different. Only by clicking them will you know their value. But do be careful. Just as the only way to win this game is by matching the target with your score, the only way to lose is by exceeding it. Just like the daytime classic The Price Is Right. So aim high, but not too high. And good luck!
