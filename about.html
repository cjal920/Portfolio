                  <p>Colin Larkin's web development philosophy is simple. Even the cleverest code is only as good as the vision it
                      serves. And if you think that sounds like a cute way of saying he's a rookie coder, well it is and you're right.
                      
                    
                    Colin Larkin is an American and a Philadelphian. His affection for town and country notwithstanding, 
                      however, Colin enjoys crossing international borders as often as possible. Colin's first overseas journey to the 
                      beautiful island of Jamaica took place when he was just four years old. Photos from the trip tell us Colin had an 
                      early fascination with numbers. Arguably the most memorable image from his Caribbean adventure depicts a young 
                      Colin proudly clutching a table sign of the number "100" from the restaurant at the hotel where he stayed with his 
                      parents. And though surely too young to grasp binary, the devilish glint in Colin's eye suggests he just might have 
                      known his own age was the same as the number on that sign. Colin wouldn't go abroad again until his teens, when he 
                      saw the Old World for the first time in the capital of the empire against whom some early hometown Philly dudes once 
                      pledged their lives, fortunes and sacred honors just down the street from where Colin currently resides. And even 
                      after some cheeky Druids made off with his asthma inhaler at Stonehenge, Colin found England to be a jolly good time indeed.</p>
