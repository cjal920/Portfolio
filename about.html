                  <p>Colin Larkin is an American and a Philadelphian. His affection for town and country notwithstanding, 
                      however, Colin enjoys crossing international borders nearly as often as his cosmopolitan brother. 
                      Colin's first overseas journey to the beautiful island of Jamaica took place when he was just four years old. 
                      Photos from the trip tell us Colin had an early fascination with numbers. Arguably the most memorable image 
                      from his Caribbean adventure depicts a young Colin proudly clutching a table sign of the number "100" from the 
                      restaurant at the hotel where he stayed with his beloved parents Marie and the late James. And though surely 
                      too young to grasp binary, the devilish glint in Colin's eye suggests he just might have known his own age was 
                      the same as the number on that sign. Colin wouldn't go abroad again until his teens, when he saw the Old World 
                      for the first time in the capital of the empire against whom some early hometown Philly dudes once pledged their 
                      lives, fortunes and sacred honors just down the street from where Colin currently resides. And even after some 
                      cheeky Druids made off with his asthma inhaler at Stonehenge, Colin found England to be a jolly good time indeed.</p>
